#Perserverence vs Failing for failing sake
I love this quote from Thomas Edison.  I think it embodies the American ideal of innovation.  This idea that if you just keep trying, keep pushing past those obstacles, you will eventually succeed.

This is not a talk about perserverence.  This is a talk about identifying failure early and then stepping into it.

What sort of things happen when you look to fail first?

#Success vs Failure
We've been raised to believe that you're either on the path to success or the road to failure.  Either you're getting up early, doing your homework, and helping old ladies across the street, or you're watching tv, doing drugs, and hanging out with the wrong crowd.  We intuitively believe that these paths are linear, as though we forget all the experiences we've had of the highs and lows to get us this far.

Sucess and Failure are merely the effect of an action (or non-aciion) we take.  If the effect is positive, we call that success.  If it's negative, we call that failure.  It's just feedback.

I got this from Jurgen Apello.  This is his Celebration Grid, and what I like about it is how it takes these two binary outcomes and draws a distinction that shows that intent matters.  In this first section we have mistakes.  Jurgen points out that if you succeed by mistake, there's nothing to celebrate there.  On the other side is what we normally think of as failures, those mistakes where we screwed up and feel bad for.

In the next section, Jurgen points out that if you're in a mindset where you're experimenting then either success or failure is great.  They're just that feedback that you're looking for and you can learn from either flavor.

In the last section Jurgen talks about practices and how we can also celebrate when we succeed by following our practices, but if you fail, it's just luck - like succeeding by mistake.

Now where I would divert from the Celebration Grid is in these other two areas of failure.  I think there's room to learn and potentially celebrate these as well.

# Why failure
The interesting thing about failure is that those lessons seem to stick with you better.  When we see another person succeed, we often can't visualize all the steps that got them to that point.  We see the success, we might try to copy the success, but we often miss a step somewhere.  On the other hand, with mistakes, we're all very good at pointing out exactly where someone went wrong.  Like the poor stormtrooper here, we've all seen a mistake like this and never repeated it.  We always check the wash for that spare red sock.  Succcess stories donâ€™t teach us anything but that they are successes.  But, what happens when you fail?  You reduce overconfidence, you rethink your strategy, and you question your assumptions.  You also want to reedeem yourself.  You become more engaged and start paying attention.

I think video games have an interesting relationship with failure.  You cannot learn to play a video game without failing at it.  It's not until you fail that you learn that those turtles are not your friends.  And what's more interesting is that video games have difficulty levels.  If the point of the video game is to "win" at it, then why play on a harder level?  Why do anything but the easiest level?  Yet, many players will start with the hardest difficulty setting.  Why?  I think it might be that you get that feedback, that failure, more rapidly.  This is how you learn the rules of the game.  When you play at an easier level you have a better chance of succeeding by mistake.  But at a harder level, mistakes are always punished and the "right" way to play the game is revealed.
